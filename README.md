Water Quality Dataset
Overview
Access to safe drinking water is a fundamental human right and is critical for health protection. Ensuring safe water is a priority at local, regional, and national levels. Investments in water supply and sanitation can have significant economic benefits by reducing health-related costs and improving public health outcomes. This dataset provides insights into the potability of water based on various quality metrics.

Dataset Description
The dataset, water_potability.csv, contains data on water quality from 3,276 different water bodies. The dataset includes several key parameters that influence water quality and potability. The target variable is Potability, indicating whether the water is safe for human consumption (1) or not (0).

Features
pH:

pH is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of water.
WHO recommends a pH range of 6.5 to 8.5 for safe drinking water.
Hardness:

Hardness is caused by dissolved calcium and magnesium salts.
It affects the water's ability to lather with soap.
Solids (Total Dissolved Solids - TDS):

TDS measures the total concentration of dissolved substances in water.
A TDS level up to 500 mg/L is considered desirable for drinking water, with a maximum limit of 1,000 mg/L.
Chloramines:

Chloramines are disinfectants used in public water systems.
A level of up to 4 mg/L is considered safe in drinking water.
Sulfate:

Sulfates are naturally occurring substances found in water.
Sulfate concentration varies, with freshwater supplies typically containing 3 to 30 mg/L.
Conductivity:

Conductivity measures water’s ability to conduct electricity, which depends on the ion concentration.
WHO recommends that conductivity should not exceed 400 μS/cm in drinking water.
Organic Carbon:

Total Organic Carbon (TOC) represents the total amount of carbon in organic compounds within water.
A TOC level below 4 mg/L is typically considered safe for water treatment.
Trihalomethanes (THMs):

THMs are by-products of chlorine treatment in water.
A THM concentration of up to 80 ppm is considered safe in drinking water.
Turbidity:

Turbidity indicates the clarity of water, influenced by suspended solids.
WHO recommends a maximum turbidity level of 5 NTU for drinking water.
Potability:

A binary variable indicating if the water is safe for consumption (1 = Potable, 0 = Not Potable).
Usage
This dataset can be used for various analyses, including:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand water quality metrics.
Machine learning models to predict the potability of water based on the provided parameters.
Environmental studies to assess the quality of water bodies across different regions.
